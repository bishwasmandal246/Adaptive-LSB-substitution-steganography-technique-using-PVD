A new algorithm designed for embedding higher capacity of data inside a 512*512 grayscale image
When you're challenged with not using many loops to check your concentration and hardwork level, a very lengthy code with less time efficiency pops up. However, check the algorithm, that's pretty cool! This algorithm improved the data hiding capacity a lot (4.03 bits per pixel) along with acceptable PSNR value.
